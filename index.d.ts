     * Tag a template literal string for localization.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * ```ts
     * $localize `some string to localize`
     * ```
     *
     * **Naming placeholders**
     *
     * If the template literal string contains expressions then you can optionally name the
     * placeholder
     * associated with each expression. Do this by providing the placeholder name wrapped in `:`
     * characters directly after the expression. These placeholder names are stripped out of the
     * rendered localized string.
     *
     * For example, to name the `item.length` expression placeholder `itemCount` you write:
     *
     * ```ts
     * $localize `There are ${item.length}:itemCount: items`;
     * ```
     *
     * If you need to use a `:` character directly an expression you must either provide a name or you
     * can escape the `:` by preceding it with a backslash:
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * ```ts
     * $localize `${label}:label:: ${}`
     * // or
     * $localize `${label}\: ${}`
     * ```
     *
     * **Processing localized strings:**
     *
     * There are three scenarios:
     *
     * * **compile-time inlining**: the `$localize` tag is transformed at compile time by a
     * transpiler,
     * removing the tag and replacing the template literal string with a translated literal string
     * from a collection of translations provided to the transpilation tool.
     *
     * * **run-time evaluation**: the `$localize` tag is a run-time function that replaces and
     * reorders
     * the parts (static strings and expressions) of the template literal string with strings from a
     * collection of translations loaded at run-time.
     *
     * * **pass-through evaluation**: the `$localize` tag is a run-time function that simply evaluates
     * the original template literal string without applying any translations to the parts. This
     * version
     * is used during development or where there is no need to translate the localized template
     * literals.
     *
     * @param messageParts a collection of the static parts of the template string.
     * @param expressions a collection of the values of each placeholder in the template string.
     * @returns the translated string, with the `messageParts` and `expressions` interleaved together.
