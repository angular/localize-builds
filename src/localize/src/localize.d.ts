/**
 * Tag a template literal string for localization.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * $localize `some string to localize`
 * ```
 *
 * **Naming placeholders**
 *
 * If the template literal string contains expressions then you can optionally name the placeholder
 * associated with each expression. Do this by providing the placeholder name wrapped in `:`
 * characters directly after the expression. These placeholder names are stripped out of the
 * rendered localized string.
 *
 * For example, to name the `item.length` expression placeholder `itemCount` you write:
 *
 * ```ts
 * $localize `There are ${item.length}:itemCount: items`;
 * ```
 *
 * If you need to use a `:` character directly an expression you must either provide a name or you
 * can escape the `:` by preceding it with a backslash:
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * $localize `${label}:label:: ${}`
 * // or
 * $localize `${label}\: ${}`
 * ```
 *
 * **Processing localized strings:**
 *
 * There are three scenarios:
 *
 * * **compile-time inlining**: the `$localize` tag is transformed at compile time by a transpiler,
 * removing the tag and replacing the template literal string with a translated literal string
 * from a collection of translations provided to the transpilation tool.
 *
 * * **run-time evaluation**: the `$localize` tag is a run-time function that replaces and reorders
 * the parts (static strings and expressions) of the template literal string with strings from a
 * collection of translations loaded at run-time.
 *
 * * **pass-through evaluation**: the `$localize` tag is a run-time function that simply evaluates
 * the original template literal string without applying any translations to the parts. This version
 * is used during development or where there is no need to translate the localized template
 * literals.
 *
 * @param messageParts a collection of the static parts of the template string.
 * @param expressions a collection of the values of each placeholder in the template string.
 * @returns the translated string, with the `messageParts` and `expressions` interleaved together.
